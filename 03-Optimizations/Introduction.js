// Optimizations
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Design algorithms that go faster, take up less space, reduce the amount of resources used
// Understand that there is a trade-off between readability and optimal code 
// Optimized code usually centers around chosing the best data structure for the situation
// For review, here is a list of commonly used data structures:
    // Tree (tries, binary search)
    // Graphs
    // Queue
    // Stack
    // Hash tables
    // Linked lists
// Sometimes sorting can help us search quickly
// Dynamic programming: breaks down a big problem into sub-problems that are overlapping
